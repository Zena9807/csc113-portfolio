# SAGE: My Study Assistant & Guide Engine

## What is SAGE?
Sage is going to be my study buddy. He will be here to answer or guide me to answers that assist me with all of my studies for this class.

## How I'll Use SAGE This Semester
I plan to use SAGE for step-by-step guides, practice with personalized quizzes on information I learned, and help if I get lost.

## Tools I'm Using
- **Primary**: Gemini - It's the most fun to use. It connects in a familiar way and has detailed information.
- **Secondary**: ChatGPT - When I have specific but general tasks that I need assistance with.
- **For Special Tasks**: I will more than likely go back to Gemini due to the short rate limit for Claude

## Ground Rules for Working with AI
1. AI will be used for support, not to answer the questions
2. AI will be used if damage has happend that I have not yet learned to repair
3. AI will be used to test my skills
4. AI will be used to breakdown information into simple tasks.
