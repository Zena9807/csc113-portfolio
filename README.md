#### Week 2: AI Tools & First Collaborations
**Date**: 1/18/26 - 1/24/26

**What I learned this week:**
- The AI tools are generally the same with a few tweaks to each one. Gemini was the most personable. It allows you to feel comfortable from the start, and recognizes that the softer more personable approach can give way to better prompting. This leads to a better experience for the user. Claude was a bit stiff. However, he lossens up with a little guidance. His responses are general, but he does offer insight into addition questions from the beginning. This is really helpful for those doing research. ChatGPT was my least favorite, but it does have a place in the AI world. Its accessable to everyone, and is well-known for convenience. This AI is also adaptive in a way that mimics the user's "energy".
- When it comes to prompt engineering, I have learned that more, but not too much information is better. Who, what and Why was such a BIG help! Now, when I am prompting, my details are taken into consideration and I get better responses. Additionally, I did try some more creative ones just for fun. Giving your AI a personality is key to those type of prompts.
- Depending on the AI, rate limits pass really quickly! Especially if you are enjoying yourself. Gemini uses queued tokens, but keep in mind in the free versions you only have so many capabilites. Claude is around 20 messages per day. That is really short. So, the thought is to be very specific. Just like the AI. ChatGPT - about 10 messages every 5 hours. 2 questions per hour is really tight!

**What challenged me:**
- This week GitHub was what challenged me the most. I used most of my prompting everyday to fix issue that I had. It was frustrating, especially with the limits.

**What I'm proud of:**
- I am proud of myself for completing the assignment. I am learning everyday. So, completing this made me feel extremely accomplished.

**Questions I still have:**
- I have SO many questions about GitHub. How do the repositories really work? Is the code writing side easier or prompting? Will I ever remember all the coding needed? What can go wrong in GitHub, that I cannot correct?
