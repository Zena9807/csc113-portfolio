### Week 2: Building My SAGE Assistant
**Date:** 2026-02-15 to 2026-02-21

**What I built:**  
I created a personalized AI study assistant called SAGE to help me with my IT and cybersecurity classes. It explains topics in simple language, gives step-by-step help for labs and commands, creates practice questions, and provides memory aids to help me remember key concepts.

**What I learned about prompt engineering:**  
I learned that the quality of the AI’s answers depends a lot on how clearly I give instructions. When I asked for specific things like step-by-step explanations, real-world examples, or shorter responses, the answers were much more useful. I also learned that adding rules helps keep the AI focused on what I actually need.

**What challenged me:**  
The hardest part was figuring out how specific my instructions needed to be. At first, the responses were sometimes too long or not focused enough. Testing and refining the instructions helped me improve the results.

**What I’m proud of:**  
I’m proud that I built an assistant that matches how I learn best. It can explain technical topics clearly, help me work through problems without doing the work for me, and give me tools like acronyms and practice questions to study more effectively. I also love that it considers my ADHD when responding. So it's short and memorable.

**Questions I still have:**  
- How can I make prompts that work well across different AI tools?  
- What is the best way to quickly check if technical answers are accurate?  
- The more that I use it, will it develop an understanding of my personality and what I am looking for without adding more rules or personality traits?
