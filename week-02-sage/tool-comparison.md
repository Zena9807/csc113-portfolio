## Comparative Analysis
All of the AI Tools used in this comparison were interesting in their response to the exact same questions. Most of the tools responded originally in a very systematic way in the first question. However, as more questions were asked, the responses varied in how “comfortable” the AI got. This comfortability may come from its understanding of human interactions. In the beginning, we are direct, generally simply answering a question from someone we just met. As we talk more, we start to show personality traits(even unexpectedly), and begin making bonds with people we feel we can trust. Each tool did exactly that at it’s own pace.

Between the 3 of them, Gemini was the first to transform it’s language into a more humanized tone. It even answered the second question with “The struggle is real.” While this is an idiom that people use humorously, it’s not something you would expect anyone to say in their initial conversation with them. It feels personal. Gemini makes you want to continue talking and even gives details that seem familiar and understandable. Claude came second with its generalized communication. It sounds like it wants to feel more familiar, but more cautious about how to handle you. This AI not only stayed positive with it’s Haiku, but answers very directly with just a touch of familiarity. This comes in the form of it’s follow up questions. It’s the kind of AI that really wants you to talk, like it wants to be your friend, but it’s unsure on how to approach you. Finally we have ChatGPT, it seems to be the most skeptical. ChatGPT waited until I opened up a little before it showed me any personality whatsoever. I think it feeds off your input and mimics your personality. If you sound direct, it sounds direct. If you sound friendly, it sounds friendly.

Overall, each have their own space in AI. I would use Gemini for most things, regular chats, basic questions and everyday challenges including how-to’s. Claude would be my go-to if I needed help with homework. It’s direct and to the point. ChatGPT would be my long-term go-to for general questions. Its convenient, fast and mimics your personality the longer you use it. They all work well. The main thing is what’s comfortable for you. Are you fun-loving and charismatic? Gemini is your guy. Are you analytical and to the point? Claude is your person. Are you skeptical and practical, but open up after a while? ChatGPT is the place for you. I’m not charismatic in any way, but I still feel more strongly connected to Gemini. It’s the one that made me feel the most comfortable. It was also the one that immediately tried to connect with me through language and continued that connection as we continued discussions.

## My Choice for Primary Tool
**Tool**: Gemini  
**Reasoning**: This tool gave the most details with the most appropriate support and conversation. 
**Backup Plan**: Switching between tools would be the best way. Gemini for harder tasks since it has the higher rate limit. Claude for tasks that need step-by-step directions, but not as difficult. ChatGPT for basic questions.
