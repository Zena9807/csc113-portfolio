# AI Tool Comparison — Week 2 Update

## My Current Tool Rankings (based on what I need)

| Rank | Tool | Best For | Limitations |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | ChatGPT | Explaining technical topics, step-by-step help, troubleshooting, study support | Can give too much information if the prompt is not specific |
| 2 | Gemini (AI Studio / SAGE) | Creating a customized assistant with consistent behavior | Responses can vary depending on how clear the instructions are |
| 3 | Claude | Writing, summaries, and organized explanations | Not as strong for hands-on technical help or troubleshooting |

## What Changed Since Last Week

After building SAGE, I realized that the quality of answers depends heavily on how clear my instructions are. Adding specific rules (like asking for step-by-step explanations or real-world examples) makes the responses much more useful. I also learned that telling the AI exactly what format I want helps prevent confusion.

## Rate Limit Experience

I did not hit any rate limits this week.

If I do in the future, I plan to:
- Write clearer prompts so I don’t need as many follow-up questions
- Save useful prompts to reuse later
- Break large questions into smaller parts, but still keep them in the same response. (I found that giving as much detail as you can the FIRST time keeps the AI from trying to combine too much information due to too many changes)
